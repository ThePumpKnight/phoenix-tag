# PHOENIX TAG - Long live Skulltag!
An attempt to bring the long-time "dead" SkullTag features to the most modern versions of GZDoom, and also making them compatible with modern mods. From shooting down bots in Deathmatch to defending against the hordes of demons in Invasion, PhoenixTag not only lets you do that but also add mods into the roaster, and customise your experience to the most utmost detail.


## MOD COMPATIBILITY
One of the main objectives I had when creating this mod was to make possible the dream of many to be able to play modern mods with, but not limited to, the Invasion gamemode ones. Since most mods have been updated and more and more versions came out, usually being compatible with GZDoom rather than the old Skulltag or even Zandronum in some cases, it was a must to ensure PhoenixTag would make that dream a reality. Hence, mod compatibility is a vital part of PhoenixTag and you are absolutely welcome to try all these maps with (almost) every mod that can come to your mind! Even tho there will still be several mods left out for a handful of different reasons, we have tried our best to create a system that guarantees most of the mods out there do work. Here´s how!

### · Mods with CPs included
Inside this mod´s .zip you will find a folder named "compatibility patches", or "CP" from now onwards here. These CP are files that MUST be loaded externally alongside PhoenixTag itself and the mod you want to play, since unfortunately we weren´t able to directly make the mod compatible just by loading it with PT. Most of these mods are Skulltag-based GZDoom mods that include several resources that produce either visual or gameplay bugs, when not crashing directly. Therefore, if a mod doesn´t work directly with PhoenixTag on the go, be sure to either take a look at the folder or the list below and see if your mod is included. If it is, you CAN play the mod with PhoenixTag, here´s how:

1º) Extract the "compatibility patches" folder from PhoenixTag.zip. There´s no need to extract the whole mod, just the CP folder.

2º) Open the extracted CP folder and search for your mod. Once you find the proper folder, compress it into a .zip file using WinRaR or a similar program. IF YOUR MOD IS SKULLTAG BASED, also apply these instructions to the Skulltag folder, located on the same CP folder under PhoenixTag.

3º) Open a mod-loading program for DooM, like ZDL, and put the mods in the following loading order:

phoenix-tag.zip

Skulltag.zip (The one you previously compressed, ONLY IF IT´S A SKULLTAG MOD)

(Your mod here)

### · Mods without CP
There are several mods that don´t work with CP themselves, since compatibility is already included with the base PhoenixTag. However, there are a series of options that should be toggled off when playing with mods and not the default "vanilla" experience, since keeping them on might cause gameplay and visual problems. Such options can be found at the bottom of the default GZDoom option menu, and are listed below:
`Replace Monsters`: with this option enabled, PhoenixTag will attempt to replace monsters randomly with a Skulltag one. For example, it´ll replace some Demons with Blood Demons, some Barons of Hell with Belphegors, and so on and so forth. 
`Replace Runes`: with this option enabled, runes will randomly replace some powerups with runes. For example, a backpack may be replaced by a Rage rune.
`Replace Items`: with this option enabled, items will randomly get replaced with Skulltag related ones. For example, a blue armor might get turned into a red one.
`Replace Weapons`: with this option enabled, weapons will randomly get replaced with Skulltag equivalents. For example, the plasma rifle can be replaced by the railgun.


## LIST OF COMPATIBLE MODS
If the mod is listed with [CP] next to it, it means that is playable via the use of compatibility patches. If it is listed with an [!] next to it, it means that despite the fact that the mod is technically playable with PhoenixTag, it might not play as intended and the gameplay might be harder than expected. If it has a [+], it means you can play it with the usual options turned `On` too if you want, since those mods won´t cause bugs or instability problems with such options.
 - Beautiful Doom
 - Brutal Doom
 - Brutal Pack
 - Call of Doom: Tarkov
 - Deathstrider [!]
 - H-Doom
 - Hideous Destructor [!]
 - Lost in Darkness [!]
 - Pandora´s Wrath [+]
 - Project Brutality
 - Supercharge [CP]
 
 IMPORTANT NOTE: HUD related mods, music mods and similars are already supposed to work with PhoenixTag, unless stated otherwise.
