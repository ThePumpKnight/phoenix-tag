Skulltag was a multiplayer source port of Doom. Skulltag was founded by Carnevil, and was the precursor to Zandronum which is a fork of Skulltag.

This archive contains the data that Skulltag was distributed alongside with, including (from skulltag.com):

Runes, new weapons, and new monsters for modders.
50 new, well designed stock maps for any game mode.

Additionally, a large collection of textures which are still used in many mods today.
