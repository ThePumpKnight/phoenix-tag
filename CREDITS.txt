Despite I (Pump_Knight) ported this to modern GZD, it´s obvious all the hard 
work behind this was carried out by the official SkullTag Team back in the day. 
They´re all listed on the map pack, so of course all credits go for them.
Besides that, the work on this project, as for now, has been carried out by
me (Pump_Knight), who brought the main concepts of how the mod would be focused
around and also the main map system code; whereas Gemini0 has been an inmense
help with anything related to the general code oriented towards Zscript and so
on, as well as the combination/linking with GitHub.
We would also like to thank the impressive work the Skulldash team did on the
Skulldash project, porting many (if not all and more) Skulltag features back 
into modern GZDoom even before we even attempted to try, as well as giving their
project their very own great personal touch. On this regard, I must specifically
thank them for letting me use Remmirath´s code from the Spread rune, a work 
without which I´d had probably been struggling with that rune for the following
hundred years.
Last but not least, a big thank you to all of the original Skulltag team for
having such an original idea back in the day. All these gamemodes, these maps
and these creations were never forgotten, and I couldn´t be happier to bring
them back to their former glory the best I could possibly do.
