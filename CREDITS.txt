Despite I (Pump_Knight) ported this to modern GZD, it´s obvious all the hard 
work behind this was carried out by the official SkullTag Team back in the day. 
They´re all listed on the map pack, so of course all credits go for them.
Besides that, the work on this project, as for now, has been carried out by
me (Pump_Knight), who brought the main concepts of how the mod would be focused
around and also the main map system code; whereas Gemini0 has been an inmense
help with anything related to the general code oriented towards Zscript and so
on, as well as the combination/linking with GitHub.
